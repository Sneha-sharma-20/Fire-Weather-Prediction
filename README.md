# Fire-Weather-Prediction
Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction System uses machine learning to predict wildfire risk from environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain, and fire indices. The project includes data preprocessing, EDA, Ridge Regression Model Training with hyperparameter tuning, and Flask-based deployment for prediction.
