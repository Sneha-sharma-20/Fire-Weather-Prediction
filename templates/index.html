                    <h2>What is FWI?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Forest Weather Index (FWI) is a numerical indicator used to
                        estimate forest fire danger based on weather conditions and
                        fuel moisture levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a comprehensive and internationally recognized system used to
                        evaluate
                        and quantify the potential risk and intensity of forest fires based solely on weather
                        conditions.
                        Developed to support fire management and disaster preparedness, the FWI integrates critical
                        meteorological
                        parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and accumulated rainfall to
                        assess how
                        conducive the environment is to wildfire ignition and spread. Rather than directly predicting
                        the occurrence
                        of fires, the FWI estimates the dryness of forest fuels and the likely behavior of a fire if
                        ignition occurs.</p>

                    <p>The system is structured into multiple components that represent different layers of forest fuel
                        moisture and fire dynamics.
                        These components collectively capture short-term and long-term drying trends, surface fuel
                        flammability, and deeper organic
                        layer conditions. By combining these elements, the FWI produces a final numerical index that
                        reflects the potential fire intensity
                        and difficulty of fire control. Higher FWI values indicate more severe fire weather conditions,
                        often associated with rapid fire spread,
                        increased flame intensity, and greater challenges for suppression efforts.</p>

                    <p>Due to its reliability and simplicity, the FWI is widely adopted by meteorological agencies,
                        forestry departments, and disaster management
                        authorities across the world. It plays a crucial role in early warning systems, strategic
                        resource
                        allocation, and policy planning related
                        to wildfire prevention and response. In research and predictive modeling, the FWI also serves as
                        an
                        important target variable, enabling the
                        development of data-driven tools that support proactive forest fire risk assessment and
                        environmental safety planning.</p>

                    <h2>Features affecting Fire</h2>
                    <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <h4>Core Meteorological Input Features</h4>

                            <b>These are the primary weather parameters required to compute the Fire Weather Index (FWI)
                                system.</b>
                            <li><b>1. Temperature (°C)</b><br> Temperature represents the ambient air temperature near
                                the forest surface.
                                Higher temperatures accelerate the drying of forest fuels, making them more combustible
                                and increasing the likelihood of fire ignition
                                and spread. </li>
                            <li><b>2. Relative Humidity (RH %)</b><br> Relative Humidity measures the amount of moisture
                                present in the air compared to the maximum it can hold at a given temperature. Low
                                relative humidity leads to drier fuels, increasing flammability and fire risk. </li>
                            <li><b>3. Wind Speed (km/h)</b><br> Wind speed indicates the horizontal movement of air near
                                the ground. Stronger winds supply oxygen to fires, increase flame length, and
                                significantly enhance the rate and direction of fire spread. </li>
                            <li><b>4. Rainfall (mm)</b><br> Rainfall represents the amount of precipitation received
                                over a given period. Rain reduces fire danger by increasing moisture content in forest
                                fuels and slowing down fuel drying processes. </li>
                        </ul>


                        <ul>
                            <h4> Moisture Codes (Intermediate Indices)</h4>

                            <b>These indices describe the moisture content of different forest fuel layers.</b>
                            <li><b>5. FFMC - Fine Fuel Moisture Code</b><br> FFMC represents the moisture content of
                                surface-level fine fuels such as dry leaves, grass, pine needles, and small twigs. It
                                reflects short-term drying and wetting effects and is highly sensitive to daily weather
                                changes. Higher FFMC values indicate very dry surface fuels that ignite easily. </li>
                            <li><b>6. DMC - Duff Moisture Code</b><br> DMC measures the moisture content of moderately
                                deep
                                organic layers (loosely compacted forest floor material). It reflects medium-term drying
                                trends influenced by temperature and rainfall over several days to weeks. Higher DMC
                                values
                                indicate drier conditions and increased fire sustainability. </li>
                            <li><b>7. DC - Drought Code</b><br> DC represents the moisture content of deep, compact
                                organic
                                soil layers. It reflects long-term drying effects caused by extended periods of dry
                                weather
                                and drought. Higher DC values indicate severe drought conditions and the potential for
                                deep-burning fires. </li>
                        </ul>


                        <ul>
                            <h4>Fire Behavior Indices</h4>

                            <b>These indices describe how a fire is likely to behave once ignited.</b>
                            <li><b>8. ISI - Initial Spread Index</b><br> ISI combines the effects of wind speed
                                and FFMC
                                to estimate the expected rate of fire spread immediately after ignition. Higher
                                ISI
                                values indicate faster-spreading fires that are harder to control. </li>
                            <li><b>9. BUI - Buildup Index</b><br> BUI represents the total amount of fuel
                                available for
                                combustion by combining DMC and DC. It reflects the overall dryness and quantity
                                of
                                burnable material in the forest. Higher BUI values indicate more fuel
                                accumulation and
                                greater fire intensity potential. </li>

                    <h2>How the Fire Weather Index (FWI) Is Calculated</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is calculated through a multi-stage process that combines
                        meteorological inputs with fuel moisture and fire behavior indices. The system does not
                        directly predict fire occurrence; instead, it estimates potential fire intensity based on
                        weather-driven fuel conditions.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Step 1: Collection of Meteorological Inputs</h4>
                    <p>
                        The calculation begins with the collection of daily weather observations, which include
                        air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. These variables influence
                        the drying and wetting of forest fuels and form the foundation of the FWI system.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Step 2: Computation of Fuel Moisture Codes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Using the meteorological inputs, three fuel moisture codes are calculated:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC):</b>
                            Estimates the moisture content of surface-level fine fuels and responds rapidly to
                            daily weather changes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Duff Moisture Code (DMC):</b>
                            Represents the moisture content of moderately deep organic layers and reflects
                            medium-term drying trends.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Drought Code (DC):</b>
                            Indicates the moisture content of deep soil layers and captures long-term drought
                            effects.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Step 3: Calculation of Fire Behavior Indices</h4>
                    <p>
                        The fuel moisture codes are then combined with wind speed to estimate fire behavior:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Initial Spread Index (ISI):</b>
                            Calculated using wind speed and FFMC, it estimates the expected rate of fire spread
                            immediately after ignition.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Buildup Index (BUI):</b>
                            Derived from DMC and DC, it represents the total amount of fuel available for
                            combustion.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Step 4: Final Fire Weather Index (FWI) Calculation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The final FWI value is computed by combining the Initial Spread Index (ISI) and the
                        Buildup Index (BUI). This value represents the potential intensity of a fire under
                        current weather conditions. Higher FWI values indicate more severe fire danger,
                        faster fire spread, and increased difficulty in fire suppression.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>
                        In summary, the FWI calculation follows a hierarchical structure:
                        meteorological inputs influence fuel moisture codes, which determine fire behavior
                        indices, ultimately producing a single Fire Weather Index value that reflects overall
                        fire danger.
                    </p>
